### How to get the SLProject

The SLProject is hosted at GitHub as a GIT repository.
[GIT](http://git-scm.com/) is a distributed versioning control system.

To clone SLProject, use the following command:

```
cd <Path to where you want the SLProject folder>
git clone https://github.com/cpvrlab/SLProject.git
```

For people with an aversion to the command line, a GIT GUI tool, such as the [GitHub Desktop Client](https://desktop.github.com), can be used.

To get the latest additions to SLProject, please checkout the develop branch:

```
git checkout develop
```

For detailed build instructions on various platforms go to the [SLProject wiki](https://github.com/cpvrlab/SLProject/wiki).
