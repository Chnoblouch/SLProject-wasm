Using CMake
---
If building a single configuration using a single generator you can
use this directory as both "source code" and "Where to build the binaries."
Of course you can create a separate build directory, if you wish.

If simultaneously using multiple configurations or generators create a
different build directory for each, e.g., win32build, androidbuild.
