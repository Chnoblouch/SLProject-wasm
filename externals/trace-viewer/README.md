# SLProject Trace Viewer

The SLProject Trace Viewer is used to open and display the trace files (.slt)
generated by the new profiler in the "utils" module.

There are three ways to open a trace file:
- Open (Ctrl + O): To open a trace file that has been generated in advance
- Reopen Last (Ctrl + R): To reopen the last opened file (remembered when the application closes)
- Profile (Ctrl + P): To create a "profiling" CMake configuration for an SLProject directory,
  define the "PROFILE" macro, build and run it and load the generated trace file

To move right and left, use the D and A keys or drag the trace with your mouse.
To zoom in and out, use the W and S keys or scroll with your mousewheel.
Details for a particular scope will be displayed in the panel at the bottom when clicked.

**Important**: This application requires a Java installation to be run
