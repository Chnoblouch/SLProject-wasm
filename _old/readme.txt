In this folder are old projects that are not anymore maintained.
Mostly these are Qt project. You can still use Qt as UI for SLProject.
If you want to build them you have to move them one folder up into the
top-level folder.
The development with Qt was stopped because the maintenance due to the
constant changes in Qt was to expensive.
